Many pet owners and animal rescuers struggle to find immediate medical help for injured or sick animals due to a lack of
accessible information on nearby veterinarians and animal welfare organizations. Additionally, when pets go missing,
current reporting methods are often ineffective, leading to delays in recovery. Without a centralized platform, pet owners 
and rescuers face difficulties in connecting with the right resources for medical assistance and lost pet reporting,
resulting in distress for both animals and their caregivers.
